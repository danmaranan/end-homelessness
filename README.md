End Homelessness
==============

This app was submitted to the Globalhack competition on October 23rd.

This app was built using Meteor.js.

My team (me and a business analyst) made it to the pro semi-finals (around 24 out of 86 teams made to the semi-finals). There were roughly 500 pro participants. So the teams had on average between 5-6 people each.

Several things are worth noting:
My background is in JavaEE not in javascript. I started looking at Meteor several months ago, but I was not able to finish the the tutorial until last weekend. This is a testimony to the strength of the platform.
